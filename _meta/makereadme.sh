echo '# Moodle tools

Automate various teaching actions in the Moodle of the university of LÃ¼beck.

Almost all scripts take these environment variables as input: 

    course   Course id
    section  Weekly section in the course 
    user     Username
    pass     Password

## Examples

Upload file "exercises.pdf" with title "Exercise Sheet":

    name="Exercise Sheet" description="Exercise Sheet" ./upload.sh exercises.pdf

Create a heading in a course:

    description="<h5>Some heading text</h5>" descriptionformat=html ./add.sh label showdescription=1

The examples assume the above environment variables have been set, so it knows in which course the content should be created.

## Installation

You only need bash and Xidel >= 0.9.9 installed. 

The scripts can then be called without installation.
